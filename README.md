MV* Framework, JavaScript

Just a simple attempt at creating a MV* framework in JavaScript.

Extendable and directive-based.

Roadmap
---
1. Completing the templating and dom building dependencies
2. Fully implementing the directives (directives have been written, but I'm currently refactoring them)
3. Creating working examples
4. Configure for test-based development

FAQ
---
1. Does this work? 
  * No, not yet. I'm refactoring an earlier attempt that does work, so it will eventually get there.
2. How is this better than Angular, Aurelia, Mithril, Vue, React, etc?
  * Short answer, it's not. Just an attempt to learn and keep brain active.
