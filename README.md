MV* Framework, JavaScript

Just a simple attempt at creating a MV* framework in JavaScript.

Extendable and directive-based.

Roadmap
---
- [x] Completing the templating and dom building dependencies - good enough for now, but needs works.
- [x] Fully implementing the standard directives
- [x] Creating working examples, first *very* simple example is included, better examples are to come.
- [ ] Configure for test-driven development
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Routing
- [ ] Better infix expression evaluation, including equality (==, !=) and relational operators (<, >, etc.)
- [ ] Mustache notation evaluation in non-textnodes (evaluation is available in controllers, but not fully built into template engine)

FAQ
---
1. Does this work? 
  * Minimally. There's a lot of code that you have to take care of yourself to get it up and running.
2. How is this better than Angular, Aurelia, Mithril, Vue, React, etc?
  * Short answer, it's not. Just an attempt to learn and keep my brain active.
